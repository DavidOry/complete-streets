1A5,Dog River Confluence,"Another view of the Dog River: If you continue down Dog River
Rd. after breaking off from the road which goes to the Amtrak Station,
you will come to the Dog River Sport Fields and Dog Park. Cross the
fields toward the river and nearby some discarded soccer nets toward
the eastern side of the field, you will come to a clear but narrow path
down to the river bank. (There looks like there maybe another path
going to same basic view, but I have not tried it.)",,44.25598,-72.601201,Recreation

1C3,Trail Access,"Lengthy trails in the National Life’s Woods trails called Rob’s Trails:
Go to the end of Mountain View Street’s western dead-end, past an
open or shut gate, then past the walled Electrical Transfer Station and
find a descending trail. It is best to take the first right diversion down
the hill to a dying Langdon Pond as this is the easiest path. The other
diversion will get you down as well. In both cases take a right turn on a
flat path past the dying pond, across a short wooden bridge until you
come to the Rob’s Trails sign. There are multiple Rob’s Trails. From the
trail sign I recommend: go up the trail and follow ribbon markers and
eventually explore the variety of trails. You may cross the major stone
wall and continue quite a ways until you can see fields lying west of
Northfield St., then return on the same path or continue and the path
will circle back a different way to the stone wall. If you get lost beyond
the stone wall, first get back to it. If you get lost either after returning

19
past the stone wall or without passing through the stone wall in the
first place, just head back and down some trail towards the sounds of
traffic to the pond path and then up the now ascending path you came
in by. It helps to observe during your original descent the place where
the pond path will take a 90 degree turn up the hill. Essentially after
passing the pond, find a path up the hill. I’ve gotten lost a few times,
but following the above ‘up and down directions’ have gotten me back
fairly easily. (Note I’ve talked to National Life people who slightly
reluctantly said it’s OK, but don’t encourage large crowds as these
woods owned by National Life is primarily for its nearby employees.
Since I’ve never have had large crowds on the many walks I’ve led there
and since National Life is such a good community supporter, I strongly
recommend small groups do take the walks, ideally with National Life
employees.",,44.25486,-72.587457,Recreation
1D1,Trail Access,"Paths in Woods of the Hill Farm Hill between Northfield and Hill
St. There are several entrances but I think the easiest to find is to walk
up a driveway directly across the street from Econo-Lodge on
Northfield St. right by a blue, decorated gate, up a driveway to an
apartment building and you will come to an old barn (my favorite barn)
located at the end of the driveway where you take a left along a
driveway-like road which fairly soon turns into a path or trail. From
there ascend the path up the Hill Farm Hill where it intersects with
another path. Take a right along a valley and beyond through its lovely
woods. On the path you will see an interesting cairn, and other objects
as well, and bump into other paths to other entrances including one
down to Hill St. and one to another spot-on Northfield St. if you turn
left instead of right after your first ascension, the path will go to
Pleasant St. If you go right at the first main intersection as most people
go, eventually you will come to the ‘Hill Farm. It is bounded by definite
No Trespassing Signs in front of a barrier fence. Many neighborhood
folks walk in these woods (not the field) and some have said ‘the
absent-from-Montpelier owner has no objection to responsible
walkers.’ Because of the many paths, be alert so you can return the
way you came in or be adventurous and see where you end up.",,44.251659,-72.580188,Recreation

Fairly soon you will come to a path to the left which will take you to the bottom of Isabel Circle. The paths forward which meander sidewards and downwards gradually fade out.
